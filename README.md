/skw√¥rm/ - Static Query ORM Library in Java

Features:

* Write your own select queries in real SQL
* Results are loaded into standard POJOs
* Full graphs of POJOs are supported with .getChildren() and .getParent() accessors
* Insert / update / delete queries are generated automatically
* Order of operations for modifications are resolved automatically
* Most hand-written queries are automatically translated to the syntax of the current DB
* When complex queries are needed, DB-specific versions can be written and will be selected automatically by DB type
* The application developer controls explicitly which queries run and when
* Database performance will never suffer from lots of auto-generated queries behind the scenes
* Lifecycle of objects is explicitly controlled by the application
* Support for: PostGreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, and MS-SQL
